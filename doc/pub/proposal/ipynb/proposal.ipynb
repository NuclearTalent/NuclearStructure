    "## Proposal for a Nuclear Talent course at the ECT* in 2017\n",
    "We would like to propose a three-week Nuclear Talent course on Theory\n",
    "for exploring nuclear structure experiments at the ECT* for the summer\n",
    "of 2017.  A similar course was\n",
    "run and organized at Ganil by Rick Casten and Piet van Isacker in\n",
    "2014. The course was oversubscribed with more than 60 student\n",
    "applications, clearly demonstrating the need in the community for the\n",
    "selected topic. We believe such a course has a strong potential to\n",
    "attract many students, theorists and experimentalists alike.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below we give a short motivation for the proposed course and the\n",
    "rationale behind the Nuclear Talent initiative. Thereafter we detail\n",
    "our course plans with learning outcomes, objectives and teaching\n",
    "philosophy, as well as various organizational and practictal matters.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "To understand why matter is stable, and thereby shed light on the\n",
    "limits of nuclear stability, is one of the overarching aims and\n",
    "intellectual challenges of basic research in nuclear physics. To\n",
    "relate the stability of matter to the underlying fundamental forces\n",
    "and particles of nature as manifested in nuclear matter, is central to\n",
    "present and planned rare isotope facilities.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Important properties of nuclear systems which can reveal information about these topics are\n",
    "for example masses, and thereby binding energies, and density\n",
    "distributions of nuclei.  These are quantities which convey important\n",
    "information on the shell structure of nuclei, with their pertinent\n",
    "magic numbers and shell closures or the eventual disappearence of the\n",
    "latter away from the valley of stability.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "During the last decade,  the study of nuclear\n",
    "structure and the models used to describe atomic nuclei are\n",
    "experiencing a renaissance. This is driven by three technological\n",
    "revolutions: accelerators capable of producing and accelerating exotic\n",
    "nuclei far from stability; instrumentation capable of detecting the\n",
    "resulting reaction products and gamma radiation, often on an\n",
    "event-by-event basis, in situations where data rates may be many\n",
    "orders of magnitude less than has been traditional; and computing\n",
    "power adequate to analyze the resulting data, often on-line, and to\n",
    "carry out sophisticated theoretical calculations to understand these\n",
    "nuclei at the limits of stability and to unravel what they tell us\n",
    "about nuclei and their structural evolution. The newly gathered data\n",
    "are revolutionizing our understanding of nuclei and leading to great\n",
    "strides in the models used to describe them. The models of the last\n",
    "half-century are now being seen as merely projections onto a subset of\n",
    "nuclei (those near stability and onto the proton-rich side of the line\n",
    "of stability) of more general theoretical approaches.  As noted above,\n",
    "we cannot expect the same quantity of data on exotic nuclei that we\n",
    "have traditionally had. Therefore we need to develop better signatures\n",
    "of structure, better models, with fewer parameters and with the\n",
    "richness needed to describe a much larger variety of structures. From\n",
    "the student's perspective, understanding the underlying theory, the\n",
    "differences in competing interpretations and how to distinguish them\n",
    "becomes all the more important. Finally, one of the best opportunities\n",
    "provided by the study of such a wider swath of nuclei is the ability\n",
    "to follow chains of isotopes (or isotones) over wide ranges of nucleon\n",
    "number, often spanning two or more major shells, to see how structure\n",
    "changes and how the occupation of very different nucleonic orbits\n",
    "affects the interplay of residual interactions and configuration\n",
    "mixing.  It is the goal and motivation of this course to introduce and\n",
    "develop many of the tools needed to carry out forefront research in\n",
    "this new era.\n",

    "## Introduction to the Talent Courses\n",
    "A recently established initiative, [Training in Advanced Low Energy Nuclear Theory](http://www.nucleartalent.org),  \n",
    "aims at providing an advanced and comprehensive training to graduate students\n",
    "and young researchers in low-energy nuclear theory. The initiative\n",
    "is a multinational network between several European and Northern\n",
    "American institutions and aims at developing a broad curriculum that\n",
    "will provide the platform for a cutting-edge theory for understanding\n",
    "nuclei and nuclear reactions. These objectives will be met by\n",
    "offering series of lectures, commissioned from experienced teachers\n",
    "in nuclear theory. The educational material generated under this\n",
    "program will be collected in the form of WEB-based courses,\n",
    "textbooks, and a variety of modern educational resources. No such\n",
    "all-encompassing material is available at present; its development\n",
    "will allow dispersed university groups to profit from the best\n",
    "expertise available.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Nuclear Talent initiative has (as of May 2016) organized and run\n",
    "successfully nine advanced courses since the summer of 2012. Three of\n",
    "these courses have been run and organized (in a very successful way)\n",
    "at the premises of the ECT*. We hope thus, if this course gets\n",
    "approved by the board of directors of the ECT*, that we can continue\n",
    "this successful and very fruitful collaboration.  The course organized\n",
    "by Giuseppina Orlandini *et al* at the ECT* last summer had more than\n",
    "fifty applicants. On average, the Nuclear Talent courses we have\n",
    "organized till now have had close to 40 applicants per course. We have\n",
    "normally accepted between 20 and 25 students, of which approximately\n",
    "five or slightly more have been either local students and/or fully\n",
    "self-supported.  In 2016 the Nuclear Talent initiatives will run two\n",
    "courses, one in the US and one in Europe.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Aims and Learning Outcomes\n",
    "This three-week TALENT course on nuclear theory will focus on the\n",
    "interpretation of data on the structure of nuclei using the Nuclear shell model as principal tool. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Format:\n",
    "\n",
    "We propose approximately forty-five hours of lectures over three weeks and a\n",
    "comparable amount of practical computer and exercise sessions, including the\n",
    "setting of individual problems and the organization of various individual projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mornings will consist of lectures and the\n",
    "afternoons will be devoted to exercises meant to shed light on the exposed theory, \n",
    "the computational projects  and individual student projects. These\n",
    "components will be coordinated to foster student engagement,\n",
    "maximize learning and create lasting value for the students. For the\n",
    "benefit of the TALENT series and of the community, material (courses,\n",
    "slides, problems and solutions, reports on students' projects) will be\n",
    "made publicly available using version control software like *git* and posted electronically on \n",
    "[github](https://github.com). \n",
    "\n",
    "As with previous TALENT courses, we envision\n",
    "the following features for the exercise sessions:\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use both individual and group work to carry out tasks that are\n",
    "very specific in technical instructions, but leave freedom for\n",
    "creativity.  Groups will be carefully put together to maximize\n",
    "diversity of backgrounds.  Results will be presented in a\n",
    "conference-like setting to create accountability.  We will organize\n",
    "events where individuals and groups exchange their experiences,\n",
    "difficulties and successes to foster interaction.  During the school,\n",
    "on-line and lecture-based training tailored to technical issues will\n",
    "be provided. Students will learn to use and interpret the results of\n",
    "computer-based and hand calculations of nuclear models. The lectures\n",
    "will be aligned with the practical computational projects and exercises and the lecturers will be\n",
    "available to help students and work with them during the exercise\n",
    "sessions.  Often, these interactions will raise topics not originally\n",
    "envisioned for the course but which are recognized to be valuable for\n",
    "the students. There will be flexibility to organize mini-lectures and\n",
    "discussion sessions on an ad-hoc basis in such cases.  Each group of\n",
    "students will maintain an online logbook of their activities and\n",
    "results.  Training modules, codes, lectures, practical exercise\n",
    "instructions, online logbooks, instructions and information created by\n",
    "participants will be merged into a comprehensive website that will be\n",
    "available to the community and the public for self-guided training or\n",
    "for use in various educational settings (for example, a graduate\n",
    "course at a university could assign some of the projects as homework\n",
    "or an extra credit project, etc).\n",
