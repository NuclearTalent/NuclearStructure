# Determine the physical system, nuclear_physics or atomic_physics.
# The atomic physics case is a quantum dot in three dimension, with a 
# Coulomb interaction computed with 3dim Harmonic Oscillator wave functions
physical_system = nuclear_physics

#  Determine what kind of effective interaction you want and the type
#  of calculation.  If you type 'open-diagrams', the code will produce
#  an effective interaction taylored to the Oslo shell-model code,
#  separated in three files, one for the pp case, one for pn and one for nn
#  For coupled-cluster calculations you will produce a file  containing
#  the effective interaction, one containing the kinetic energy and one
#  for the total single-particle energies.
#  You can also compute the binding energy of various closed core nuclei
#  The options are thus  1) open-diagrams for shell-model, 2) coupled-cluster
#  and 3) core-diagrams
#  Note well that if you choose coupled-cluster here, that will generate 
#  an effective interaction to first order (either with HF or with HO basis)
#  
type_of_interaction =  open-diagrams

#  You can also compute results to a given order in many-body perturbation
#  theory, in this case to third order. Options are 1) first, 2) second  and
#  3) third.   For coupled-cluster you have to stay with first order
order_of_interaction = first

#  Determine the type of many-body interaction you want, here you can select
#  onebody, twobody and threebody
manybody_interaction = onebody


#  You can also compute the effective one-body operator for Gamow-Teller,
#  Electro and magnetic operators.   The options are 
#  1) gamow-teller,  2) electro, 3) magnetic and 4) none.  You need also to
#  read the value of lambda. It is one for gamow-teller, 2 for E2, 1 for M1 etc.
type_of_operator = none
lambda = 2

#  Hartree-Fock option: Determine whether you want to do Hartree-Fock or not.
#  Options are 1) hf_iterations =0, no Hartree-Fock or 2) hf_iterations = 1 or any 
#  number larger than 0. For multishell effective interactions you may use 
#  a Hartree-Fock basis in order to avoid possible poles in a Harmonic oscillator
#  basis. Alternatively, use a shifted harmonic oscillator basis.
#  The HF calculation changes also your single-particle energies.  The final sp energies
#  may not be too realistic and can produce very small energy denominators when you do
#  many-body perturbation theory. A proper description can only be achieved if for example
#  three-body forces
#  are included.  The option original_spnergies allows you  to keep for example an experimental sp spectrum.
#  Use either 1) yes or 2) no in order to keep the original energies.  The HF codes runs only at 
#  the level of first-order perturbation theory. 
hf_iterations = 0
keep_original_spenergies = yes


# MBPT option : Number of hbar_omega excitations in the various diagrams when you do MBPT, 
# typically two or larger
hbaromega_excitations  =  10


# A-dependent Hamiltonian : The no-core interaction is A-dependent by definition, but you
# can add a kinetic CoM correction to the G-matrix and the Vlowk Hamiltonians. To do this
# you choose between two options 1) no  or 2) yes
# When you generate effectives for  for the Shell-Model you normally endup using experimental
# single-particle energies and  then you should choose option 1).  For no-core you must always
# use option 2).
