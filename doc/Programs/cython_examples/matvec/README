This code contains example to run a matrix vector operation using 4 different
approaches. The first is the standard python approach with for loops, the second
is a version using cython. The third uses list comprehension and vector
operation in python, while the last calls the matmul function from numpy.

The cython module is in the file matvec.pyx, while setup.py contains information to
compile and build the module using distutils.

To compile the cython module, run:
        python setup.py build_ext --inplace

To execute example, run:
        python example.py 5000
