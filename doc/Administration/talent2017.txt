                         2017 TALENT Course

Applications are open for the 2017 TALENT course on Theory for
exploring Nuclear Structure experiments.  The recently established
initiative, Nuclear TALENT (Training in Advanced Low Energy Nuclear Theory), 
see also http://www.nucleartalent.org, a multi-national network of
several European and North American institutions, aims to develop a
broad curriculum that will serve as a platform for cutting-edge theory
of nuclei and their reactions.


This year the Nuclear TALENT initiative organizes a course on 
"Theory for Exploring Nuclear Structure Experiments" to be held at
at The European Center for Theoretical Nuclear Physics and Related Areas
(ECT*), Trento, Italy from July 3 to July 21 2017. 

The lecturers are Alex Brown (Michigan State
University), Alexandra Gade (Michigan State University), Robert
Grzywacz (University of Tennessee and Oak Ridge National Laboratory),
Morten Hjorth-Jensen (Michigan State University and University of
Oslo), and Gustav Jansen (Oak Ridge National Laboratory).

The deadline for applications is April 15, 2017.  
For more information on how  to apply see http://ectstar.eu/node/797,
see also http://ectstar.eu/node/2240. A detailed content list can be found at
http://nucleartalent.github.io/NuclearStructure/doc/web/course.html


The target groups are Master of Science and PhD students and
early post-doctoral researchers, both experimentalists and
theorists. More experienced researchers may apply, but will be
considered only on a fully-self-supported basis if numbers and space
permit. Local support is available for at most 15-20 participants.

For additional information on each of the courses, please see
http://www.nucleartalent.org. Prior to the TALENT course, the ECT* organizes 
a Doctoral Training program on Microscopic Theories of Nuclear Structure, Dynamics and 
Electroweak Currents from June 12 to June 30, 2017. 
The doctoral training program can be combined with the TALENT course.
Applicants interested in attending the doctoral training program can find more information at
