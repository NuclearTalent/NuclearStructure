TITLE: Theory for Exploring Nuclear Structure Experiments
AUTHOR: Nuclear TALENT COURSE 2017 at The European Center for Theoretical Nuclear Physics and Related Areas, Trento, Italy
DATE: July 3-21, 2017

===== TALENT course 2017 =====

Applications are open for the 2017 TALENT course on 
_Theory for exploring Nuclear Structure experiments_.  The recently established
initiative, Nuclear TALENT (Training in Advanced Low Energy Nuclear Theory), 
see also URL:"http://www.nucleartalent.org", a multi-national network of
several European and North American institutions, aims to develop a
broad curriculum that will serve as a platform for cutting-edge theory
of nuclei and their reactions.


This year the Nuclear TALENT initiative organizes a course on 
"Theory for Exploring Nuclear Structure Experiments" to be held at
at The European Center for Theoretical Nuclear Physics and Related Areas
(ECT*), Trento, Italy from July 3 to July 21 2017.

===== How to apply and teaching material =====

_The deadline for applications is April 15, 2017_.  
For more information on how  to apply see URL:"http://ectstar.eu/node/797",
see also URL:"http://ectstar.eu/node/2240". A detailed content list can be found at
URL:"http://nucleartalent.github.io/NuclearStructure/doc/web/course.html".

The target groups are Master of Science and PhD students and
early post-doctoral researchers, both experimentalists and
theorists interested in models for nuclear
structure, phenomenological techniques for interpreting and predicting
the structure of stable as well as exotic nuclei. More experienced researchers may apply, but will be
considered only on a fully-self-supported basis if numbers and space
permit. Local support is available for at most 15-20 participants.

===== Additional information =====

For additional information on each of the courses, please see
URL:"http://www.nucleartalent.org". Prior to the TALENT course, the ECT* organizes 
a Doctoral Training program on Microscopic Theories of Nuclear Structure, Dynamics and 
Electroweak Currents from June 12 to June 30, 2017. 
The doctoral training program can be combined with the TALENT course.
