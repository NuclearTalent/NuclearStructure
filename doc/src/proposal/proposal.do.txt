===== Motivation =====

The study of nuclear structure and the models used to describe atomic
nuclei are experiencing a renaissance. This is driven by three
technological revolutions: accelerators capable of producing and
accelerating exotic nuclei far from stability; instrumentation capable
of detecting the resulting reaction products and gamma radiation,
often on an event-by-event basis, in situations where data rates may
be many orders of magnitude less than has been traditional; and
computing power adequate to analyze the resulting data, often on-line,
and to carry out sophisticated theoretical calculations to understand
these nuclei at the limits of stability and to unravel what they tell
us about nuclei and their structural evolution. The newly gathered
data are revolutionizing our understanding of nuclei and leading to
great strides in the models used to describe them. The models of the
last half-century are now being seen as merely projections onto a
subset of nuclei (those near stability and onto the proton-rich side
of the line of stability) of more general theoretical approaches.  As
noted above, we cannot expect the same quantity of data on exotic
nuclei that we have traditionally had. Therefore we need to develop
better signatures of structure, better models, with fewer parameters
and with the richness needed to describe a much larger variety of
structures. From the student's perspective, understanding the
underlying theory, the differences in competing interpretations and
how to distinguish them becomes all the more important. Finally, one
of the best opportunities provided by the study of such a wider swath
of nuclei is the ability to follow chains of isotopes (or isotones)
over wide ranges of nucleon number, often spanning two or more major
shells, to see how structure changes and how the occupation of very
different nucleonic orbits affects the interplay of residual
interactions and configuration mixing.  It is the goal and motivation
of this course to introduce and develop many of the tools needed to
carry out forefront research in this new era.

===== Introduction to the Talent Courses =====

A recently established initiative, "Training in Advanced Low Energy Nuclear Theory":"www.nucleartalent.org",  
aims at providing an advanced and comprehensive training to graduate students
and young researchers in low-energy nuclear theory. The initiative
is a multinational network between several European and Northern
American institutions and aims at developing a broad curriculum that
will provide the platform for a cutting-edge theory for understanding
nuclei and nuclear reactions. These objectives will be met by
offering series of lectures, commissioned from experienced teachers
in nuclear theory. The educational material generated under this
program will be collected in the form of WEB-based courses,
textbooks, and a variety of modern educational resources. No such
all-encompassing material is available at present; its development
will allow dispersed university groups to profit from the best
expertise available.

The advanced training network in nuclear theory will provide students
(theorists and experimentalists) with a broad background in methods
and techniques that can be easily applied to other domains of science
and technology. The characteristic feature of this initiative is
training in multi-scale nuclear physics. This knowledge is crucial,
not only for a basic understanding of atomic nuclei, but also for
further development of knowledge-oriented industry; from
nanotechnology and material science to biological sciences, to high
performance computing. As such, the proposed training aims at
providing an inter-disciplinary education when it comes to theories
and methods.

The ultimate goal of the proposal is to develop a graduate program of
excellence in low-energy nuclear theory. The program will build strong
connections between universities and research laboratories and
institutes worldwide and provide a unique training ground for the
future needs of nuclear physics.



===== Aims and Learning Outcomes =====

This three-week TALENT course on nuclear theory focused on the
interpretation of data on the structure of nuclei. The aims were to
familiarize the student with the phenomenology of nuclear structure
and to discuss a wide variety of models and techniques to interpret
such data. The theoretical bases of these approaches was discussed and
practical exercise sessions were organized requiring the use of
available computer codes as well as hand calculations. The set of
lectures provided students with the tools necessary to perform
calculations, and to use these calculations to interpret data from
experiments on nuclei near and far from stability.

=== Format: === 
We propose approximately forty-five hours of lectures and a
comparable amount of practical exercise sessions, including the
setting of individual problems and the organization of
mini-projects. The mornings will consist of lectures and the
afternoons will be devoted to exercises and student projects. These
two components will be coordinated to foster student engagement,
maximize learning and create lasting value for the students. For the
benefit of the TALENT series and of the community, material (courses,
slides, problems and solutions, reports on students' projects) will be
made publicly available. As with previous TALENT courses, we envision
the following features for the exercise sessions:

We will use both individual and group work to carry out tasks that are
very specific in technical instructions, but leave freedom for
creativity.  Groups will be carefully put together to maximize
diversity of backgrounds.  Results will be presented in a
conference-like setting to create accountability.  We will organize
events where individuals and groups exchange their experiences,
difficulties and successes to foster interaction.  During the school,
on-line and lecture-based training tailored to technical issues will
be provided. Students will learn to use and interpret the results of
computer-based and hand calculations of nuclear models. The lectures
will be aligned with the practical exercises and the lecturers will be
available to help students and work with them during the exercise
sessions.  Often, these interactions will raise topics not originally
envisioned for the course but which are recognized to be valuable for
the students. There will be flexibility to organize mini-lectures and
discussion sessions on an ad-hoc basis in such cases.  Each group of
students will maintain an online logbook of their activities and
results.  Training modules, codes, lectures, practical exercise
instructions, online logbooks, instructions and information created by
participants will be merged into a comprehensive website that will be
available to the community and the public for self-guided training or
for use in various educational settings (for example, a graduate
course at a university could assign some of the projects as homework
or an extra credit project, etc).


=== Objectives: ===
At the end of the course students should have greatly
expanded familiarity with a variety of nuclear models, should be able
to carry out explicit calculations with these models and to think
about new data on atomic nuclei in order to understand their
structural implications, and should have a grasp of the evolution of
structure with proton and neutron number and the drivers of such
evolution. Efficient methods to estimate structure from a minimum of
data and to predict the structure of unknown nuclei in the absence of
data will be developed. The students will also have an enhanced
ability to decide which observables and which experiments are key to
further progress in a variety of structural domains (magic nuclei,
near-magic nuclei, nuclei with emergent collectivity, well-deformed
nuclei, both even- and odd-mass nuclei). More specifically, at the end
of the course students should:

Be able to look up and interpret data on the evolution of nuclear
structure.  Have a working knowledge of angular momentum or SO(3)
theory in quantum mechanics and have a qualitative idea of its
generalization to arbitrary Lie algebras.  Understand the uses and
limitations of algebraic methods in many-body physics.  Be familiar
with the basic models of nuclei (spherical shell model, Nilsson model,
pairing models, geometric and algebraic collective models).  Be able
to carry out simple calculations (hand and computer, for both
even-mass and odd-mass nuclei) with a variety of the above models.  Be
able to use all of the above models and techniques to understand
drivers of shell structure and structural evolution.  Be able to
exploit a number of phenomenological schemes to interpret data on
nuclear structure and to estimate the properties of unknown nuclei.


===== Course Content =====


=== Overview: ===


Given that several sub-topics are involved and that students will have
a variety of backgrounds and experience, it is important to give
students the language needed to communicate. After this background is
introduced we will begin by looking at the data on atomic nuclei. It
has been said often in recent years that there are two general
perspectives with which to view nuclei: a *microscopic* (literally *femtoscopic*) 
approach focusing on nucleonic motion, quantum numbers
and interactions, and a *macroscopic* approach that looks at the
nucleus as a whole, as a coherent many-body system with its own
properties. The course will look at both avenues to understanding
nuclei, to their inter-relationships, and will illustrate how advances
in one can illuminate the other. The development of nuclear models
divorced from the context of the data that they need to interpret is
often confusing and bewildering. Therefore, early lectures will
provide an overview of the data on atomic nuclei spanning from light
nuclei to superheavy species, looking at data ranging from integral
observables such as masses and charge radii to specific spectroscopic
data that provide insights into structure either from the nucleonic
perspective or from the many-body perspective of nuclear symmetries,
many-body quantum numbers, selection rules and the like.




The course ends with a final assignment. The final assignment will be graded
with marks A, B, C, D, E and failed for Master students and passed/not passed for PhD students.
