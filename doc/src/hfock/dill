Our Hamiltonian contains one-body, two-body and three-body contributions and in 
the equations below, we  label states below the Fermi level $F$ as $i,j,\ldots$ while states 
above the Fermi level are defined by $a,b,\ldots$. General single-particle states
are given by the letters  $p,q \dots$. The
quantities $pq\dots$ represent the quantum numbers of various
single-particle states, namely
$p=(n_p,l_p,j_p,m_{j_p},t_{z_p})$.   
The commutation relations for creation and annihilations operators with respect to
a given reference state are then given by

!bt
\begin{equation*}
   \left\{a_p^\dagger, a_q \right\}= \delta_{pq}, p, q \leq F \hspace{0.5cm} \left\{a_p, a_q^\dagger \right\} =
        \delta_{pq}, p, q > F.
\end{equation*}
!et
The action of the creation and annihilation operators with respect to a reference state $\Phi_0$ are then given by
 $a_i|\Phi_0\rangle = |\Phi_i\rangle$ where a state labeled by $|\Phi_i\rangle$ means that a particle in a 
single-particle state $i$ has been removed. Similarly, we have $a_a^\dagger|\Phi_0\rangle = |\Phi^a\rangle$, $a_i^\dagger|\Phi_0\rangle = 0$ 
and $a_a|\Phi_0\rangle = 0$.  With the above definitions, we write our Hamiltonian as

!bt
\begin{equation*}
\hat{H}=\hat{H}_0+\hat{V}+\hat{W},
\end{equation*}
!et
where 
the single-particle part is given by

!bt
\begin{equation*}
    \hat{H}_0 = \sum_{pq} \langle p|\hat{h}_0|q\rangle a_p^\dagger a_q.
 \end{equation*}
!et
This part of the Hamiltonian is commonly defined in terms of some external potential like the three-dimensional 
harmonic oscillator or a particular mean-field basis. 
Similarly, the two-body part of the Hamiltonian
is given by

!bt
\begin{equation*}
  \hat{V} = \frac{1}{4}\sum_{pqrs} \langle pq|\hat{v}|rs\rangle_{\mathrm{AS}} a_p^\dagger a_q^\dagger a_s a_r
\end{equation*}
!et
where we have employed antisymmetric matrix elements defined as

!bt
\begin{equation*}
\langle pq|\hat{v}|rs\rangle_{\mathrm{AS}}=\langle pq|\hat{v}|rs\rangle-\langle pq|\hat{v}|sr\rangle.
\end{equation*}
!et
We will assume throughout this work that the  two-body operator $\hat{v}$ is given by a nucleon-nucleon interaction.

Finally, the three-body part of our Hamiltonian operator  is defined by

!bt
\begin{equation*}
   \hat{W} =\frac{1}{36} \sum_{pqrstu} \langle pqr|\hat{w}|stu\rangle_{\mathrm{AS}}a_p^\dagger a_q^\dagger a_r^\dagger a_u a_t a_s,
\end{equation*}
!et
where we have defined the antisymmetric matrix elements

!bt
\begin{equation*}
          \langle pqr|\hat{w}|stu\rangle_{\mathrm{AS}}= \langle pqr|\hat{w}|stu\rangle + \langle pqr|\hat{w}|tus\rangle + \langle pqr|\hat{w}|ust\rangle- \langle pqr|\hat{w}|sut\rangle - \langle pqr|\hat{w}|tsu\rangle - \langle pqr|\hat{w}|uts\rangle.
\end{equation*}
!et
We will in the discussions to come drop the $\mathrm{AS}$ subscript,
assuming thereby that all matrix elements are antisymmetrized.
Introducing a reference state $|\Phi_0\rangle$ as our new vacuum state
leads to a redefinition of the Hamiltonian in terms of a constant
reference energy $E_0$ defined as

!bt
\begin{equation*}
E_0 = \sum_{i\le F}\langle i | \hat{h}_0|i\rangle+\frac{1}{2}\sum_{ij\le F} \langle ij|\hat{v}|ij\rangle +\frac{1}{6}\sum_{ijk\le F} \langle ijk|\hat{w}|ijk\rangle,
\end{equation*}
!et
and a normal-ordered Hamiltonian

!bt
\begin{equation*}
  \hat{H}_N=\sum_{pq}\langle p|\tilde{f}|q\rangle a^\dagger_p a_q+\frac{1}{4} \sum_{pqrs} \langle pq|\tilde{v}|rs\rangle a^\dagger_p a^\dagger_q a_s  a_r +\frac{1}{36} \sum_{\substack{pqr \\stu}}
                 \langle pqr|\hat{w}|stu\rangle a^\dagger_p a^\dagger_q a^\dagger_r a_u a_t a_s 
\end{equation*}
!et
where

!bt
\begin{equation*}
\langle p| \tilde{f}|q\rangle = \langle p|\hat{h}_0|q\rangle +\sum_{i\le F} \langle pi|\hat{v}|qi\rangle+\frac{1}{2}\sum_{ij\le\alpha_F} \langle pij|\hat{w}|qij\rangle,
\end{equation*}
!et 
represents a correction to the single-particle operator $\hat{h}_0$ due to contributions from the nucleons below the Fermi level.
The two-body matrix elements are now modified in order to account for medium-modified contributions from the three-body interaction, resulting in

!bt
\begin{equation}
\langle pq|\tilde{v}|rs\rangle=\langle pq|\hat{v}|rs\rangle+\sum_{i\le F} \langle pqi|\hat{w}|rsi\rangle.
label{eq:twobodyveff}
\end{equation}
!et
In Eq. (ref{eq:twobodyveff}), the effective two-body interaction
$\tilde{v}$ can contain both a standard two-nucleon interaction and a
density dependent contribution stemming from a three-body interaction
$\hat{w}$.

An important ingredient in studies of effective interactions and their
applications to nuclear structure, is the so-called monopole
interaction, normally defined in terms of a nucleon-nucleon
interaction $\hat{v}$

!bt
\begin{equation}
\bar{V}_{\alpha_p\alpha_q} = \frac{\sum_{J}(2J+1) \langle (\alpha_p\alpha_q)J | \hat{v} | (\alpha_p\alpha_q)J \rangle }{\sum_{J}(2J+1)},
label{eq:monopole1}
\end{equation}
!et
where the total angular momentum of a two-body state $J$ runs over all
possible values.  
In the above equation we have defined a nucleon-nucleon interaction in a so-called angular-momentum 
coupled representation with the symbol $\alpha_{p,q}$ representing all possible quantum numbers except the 
magnetic substates $m_{j_{p,q}}$
The monopole Hamiltonian can be interpreted as an angle-averaged matrix element.  
We have assumed that the single-particle angular momenta $j_p$ and $j_q$ couple to a total
two-particle angular momentum $J$.  The summation over $J$ with the value $2J+1$ can be replaced
by $\sum_J(2J+1)=(2j_p+1)(2j_q+1)$ if $\alpha_p\ne \alpha_q$. If $\alpha_p=\alpha_q$ we can generalize this equation to, assuming that 
our states can represent either protons or neutrons,

!bt
\begin{equation}
\sum_{J}(2J+1)=(2j_p+1)(2j_q+1-\delta_{\alpha_p\alpha_q}).
label{eq:jvalue}
\end{equation}
!et
The spherical single-particle states,
provide an important ingredient for the formation of shells and
interplay between spherical configurations and deformation in
nuclei. Large shell gaps obtained from a monopole Hamiltonian are a
prerequisite to obtain certain magic numbers. 
Equation (ref{eq:monopole1}) can also be expressed in terms of the
medium-modified two-body interaction defined in
Eq. (ref{eq:twobodyveff}), that is we can have

!bt
\begin{equation}
\tilde{V}_{\alpha_p\alpha_q} = \frac{\sum_{J}(2J+1) \langle (\alpha_p\alpha_q)J | \tilde{v} | (\alpha_p\alpha_q)J \rangle }{\sum_{J}(2J+1)}.
label{eq:monopole2}
\end{equation}
!et
As stated in the introduction, one of the
aims of this work is to study the role of three-body interactions in
nuclear structure, with an emphasis on the evolution of
single-particle energies.


The single-particle energy $\epsilon_p$ resulting from for example a self-consistent Hartree-Fock field, 
or from  first order in many-body perturbation theory, is given by (in an uncoupled basis)

!bt
\begin{equation*}
\epsilon_p=\langle p| \tilde{f}|p\rangle = \langle p|\hat{h}_0|p\rangle +\sum_{i\le F} \langle pi|\hat{v}|pi\rangle+\frac{1}{2}\sum_{ij\le\alpha_F} \langle pij|\hat{w}|pij\rangle,
\end{equation*}
!et
where we have included the three-body interaction as well.
We can rewrite this equation in an angular coupled basis ($jj$-coupled basis) as

!bt
\begin{equation}
\epsilon_{\alpha_p}= \langle \alpha_p|\hat{h}_0|\alpha_p\rangle+\frac{1}{2j_p+1}\sum_{\alpha_i\le \alpha_F}\sum_{J} (2J+1)\langle (\alpha_p\alpha_i)J | \hat{v} | (\alpha_p\alpha_i)J \rangle,
label{eq:spequation1}
\end{equation}
!et
or

!bt
\begin{equation}
\epsilon_{\alpha_p}= \langle \alpha_p|\hat{h}_0|\alpha_p\rangle+\frac{1}{2j_p+1}\sum_{\alpha_i\le \alpha_F}\sum_{J} (2J+1)\langle (\alpha_p\alpha_i)J | \tilde{v} | (\alpha_p\alpha_i)J \rangle,
label{eq:spequation2}
\end{equation}
!et
where the first equation contains a two-body force only while
Eq. (ref{eq:spequation2}) includes the medium-modified contribution
from the three-body interaction as well. In
Eqs. (ref{eq:spequation1}) and (ref{eq:spequation2}), we have
used a compact notation for the single-particle states, with the
symbol $\alpha_p$ etc representing all possible quantum numbers except
the magnetic substates $m_{j_p}$, that is $\alpha_p=(n_p,l_p,j_p,t_{z_p})$. The symbol $\alpha_F$ stands now for
all single-particle states up to the Fermi level, excluding again the
magnetic substates.  In the above two-body interaction matrix elements
$\langle (\alpha_p\alpha_i)J | \hat{v}(\tilde{v}) |(\alpha_p\alpha_i)J \rangle$ we have dropped additional quantum
numbers like the isospin projection. Our interactions are diagonal in
the projection of the total isospin but breaks both isospin symmetry
and charge symmetry.

Depending on the choice of single-particle Hamiltonian, the quantity
$\langle \alpha_p|\hat{h}_0|\alpha_p\rangle$ could represent the expectation value of the single-particle
kinetic energy or the eigenstate of a single-particle Hamiltonian
$\hat{h}_0$. The latter could for example be the solution of
Schr\"odinger's equation for a particle moving in a Woods-Saxon like
single-particle potential, or the widely employed harmonic oscillator
in three dimensions.

Using the definition of the single-particle energy in
Eq. (ref{eq:spequation1}), the definition of the monopole matrix
element in Eqs. (ref{eq:monopole1}) or (ref{eq:monopole2}) and Eq. (ref{eq:jvalue}), we can rewrite
Eq. (ref{eq:spequation1}) as

!bt
\begin{equation}
\epsilon_{\alpha_{p}}=\langle \alpha_p|\hat{h}_0|\alpha_p\rangle+\sum_{\alpha_i\le \alpha_F}N_{\alpha_i}\bar{V}_{\alpha_p\alpha_i},
label{eq:spmono1}
\end{equation}
!et
with $N_{\alpha_i}=2\alpha_i+1$, and Eq. (ref{eq:spequation2}) as

!bt
\begin{equation}
\epsilon_{\alpha_{p}}=\langle \alpha_p|\hat{h}_0|\alpha_p\rangle+\sum_{\alpha_i\le \alpha_F}N_{\alpha_i}\tilde{V}_{\alpha_p\alpha_i}.
label{eq:spmono2}
\end{equation}
!et



The effective interaction is a
scalar two-body operator. A general scalar two-body operator
$\hat{v}$ can be written as

!bt
\begin{equation}
\hat{v} = \sum_{k} \hat{v}_{k} = \sum_{k} \mbox{\boldmath $C^{(k)}\cdot
Q^{(k)}$},
\end{equation}
!et
where the operators \mbox{\boldmath $C^{(k)}$} and
\mbox{\boldmath $Q^{(k)}$} are irreducible spherical tensor
operators of rank $k$, acting in spin and coordinate space,
respectively. The value of $k$ is limited to $k\le 2$ since the total eigenspin of the two-nucleon
system is either $0$ or $1$. The term with
$k=0$ refers to the central component of the two-body
operator.
The values of $k=1$ and $k=2$ are called
the vector and the tensor components, respectively. The vector term is also called the two-body spin-orbit term, although it
also contains the anti-symmetric spin-orbit term, see for example Ref. cite{conze1973} for further details.
Using standard angular momentum algebra it is rather straightforward to relate the matrix elements  $\hat{v}_{k}$ to
those of say $\hat{v}$ or $\tilde{v}$. 

One possible decomposition of the effective interaction is to
express the $k$-th component of the interaction $\langle
(\alpha_p\alpha_q)J|\hat{v}_{k}|(\alpha_r\alpha_s)J\rangle $ in a $jj$-coupled basis, where
$\hat{v}_k$ is related to the matrix
elements $\langle (\alpha_p\alpha_q)J|\hat{v}|(\alpha_r\alpha_s)J\rangle $ (or $\langle (\alpha_p\alpha_q)J|\tilde{v}|(\alpha_r\alpha_s)J\rangle $ 
through the relation

!bt

!bt
\begin{align}
\langle (\alpha_p\alpha_q)J|\hat{v}_{k}|(\alpha_r\alpha_s)J\rangle&=(-1)^{J}(2k+1)
\sum_{LL'SS'}\langle
\alpha_p\alpha_q|LSJ\rangle \langle \alpha_r\alpha_s|L'S'J\rangle
\left\{ \begin{array}{ccc}
		       L&S&J\\
		       S'&L'&k
		       \end{array}
		 \right\} \nonumber \\
& &\times \sum_{J'}(-1)^{J'}(2J'+1)\left\{ \begin{array}{ccc}
		       L&S&J'\\
		       S'&L'&k
		       \end{array}
		 \right\}
\sum_{\alpha_{p}'\alpha_{q}'\alpha_{r}'\alpha_{s}'}\langle \alpha_p'\alpha_q'|LSJ'\rangle
\nonumber\\
& &\times \langle \alpha_r'\alpha_s'|L'S'J'\rangle \langle
(\alpha_p'\alpha_q')J'|\hat{v}|(\alpha_r'\alpha_s')J'\rangle .  label{eq:jj}
\end{align}
!et
!et
The two-particle matrix elements are normalized and antisymmetrized.
A similar expression applies to the medium-modified two-body interaction $\tilde{v}$ of 
Eq. (ref{eq:twobodyveff}) as well.
The symbol $\langle \alpha_p\alpha_q|LSJ \rangle $ is a shorthand
for the $LS-jj$ transformation coefficient,

!bt
\begin{equation*}
\langle \alpha_p\alpha_q|\lambda SJ \rangle = \sqrt{(2j_{p}+1)(2j_{q}+1)(2\lambda+1)(2S+1)}
\left\{
\begin{array}{ccc}
       l_{p}&\frac{1}{2}&j_{p}\\
       l_{q}&\frac{1}{2}&j_{q}\\
       \lambda    &S          &J
\end{array}
\right\}
\end{equation*}
!et
The transformation from an $LS$ basis to a $jj$-coupled scheme is then given by the relation

!bt
\begin{equation*}
|(\alpha_p\alpha_q)J\rangle  = \sum_{LS}\langle \alpha_p\alpha_q|LSJ \rangle |(\tilde{\alpha}_p\tilde{\alpha}_q)LSJ\rangle,
\end{equation*}
!et 
where the symbol like $\tilde{\alpha}_{p}$ refers to the quantum numbers in an $LS$ basis, that is
$\tilde{\alpha}_{p}=(n_{p},l_{p},s_{p},t_{z_{p}})$.

To derive Eq. (ref{eq:jj}), we have used the fact that the two-body
matrix elements of $\hat{v}_k$ can also be interpreted in the
representation of the $LS$-coupling scheme as in
Refs. cite{elliott1968,kirson1973,brown1988,osnes1992,richter1991,smirnova2010}. This
representation allows for a more direct comparison with the
nucleon-nucleon interaction, a quantity normally defined in terms of
the partial waves of the center-of-mass and relative motion system,
see for example Ref. cite{machleidt2011}.  Similar to the
decomposition in the $jj$-scheme, the $LS$-coupled matrix element of a
given component $k$ $\bra{(\tilde{\alpha}_p\tilde{\alpha}_q
  )LSJ'T}\hat{v}_{k}\ket{(\tilde{\alpha}_r\tilde{\alpha}_s )LSJ'T} $
are related to the corresponding matrix elements of the total
interaction in the $jj$-scheme by

!bt
\begin{equation*}
\begin{array}{ll}
&\\
\bra{(\tilde{\alpha}_p\tilde{\alpha}_q )LSJ'T}\hat{v}_{k}\ket{(\tilde{\alpha}_r\tilde{\alpha}_s )L'S'J'T}&=
{\displaystyle\frac{1}{\sqrt{(1+\delta_{\tilde{\alpha}_p\tilde{\alpha}_q})(1+\delta_{\tilde{\alpha}_r\tilde{\alpha}_s})}}}
(-1)^{J'}\hat{k}\left\{\begin{array}{ccc}L&S&J'\\S'&L'&k
\end{array}\right\}
\\&\\
&\times {\displaystyle\sum_{J}}(-1)^{J}\hat{J}\left\{\begin{array}{ccc}L&S&J\\S'&L'&k
\end{array}\right\}
{\displaystyle \sum_{\alpha_p \alpha_q \alpha_r \alpha_s}}
\langle \alpha_p\alpha_q|LSJ\rangle
\langle \alpha_r\alpha_s|L'S'J\rangle
\\&\\
&\times\sqrt{(1+\delta_{\alpha_p\alpha_q})(1+\delta_{\alpha_r\alpha_s})}\bra{(\alpha_p\alpha_q)JT}\hat{v}\ket{(\alpha_r\alpha_s)JT}
.\end{array}
\end{equation*}
