===== Why Hartree-Fock?  =====
!bblock
Hartree-Fock (HF) theory is an algorithm for finding an approximative expression for the ground state of a given Hamiltonian. The basic ingredients are
 *  Define a single-particle basis $\{\psi_{\alpha}\}$ so that
!bt
\[ 
\hat{h}^{\mathrm{HF}}\psi_{\alpha} = \varepsilon_{\alpha}\psi_{\alpha}
\]
!et
with the Hartree-Fock Hamiltonian defined as
!bt
\[
\hat{h}^{\mathrm{HF}}=\hat{t}+\hat{u}_{\mathrm{ext}}+\hat{u}^{\mathrm{HF}}
\]
!et
 *  The term  $\hat{u}^{\mathrm{HF}}$ is a single-particle potential to be determined by the HF algorithm.
 *  The HF algorithm means to choose $\hat{u}^{\mathrm{HF}}$ in order to have 
!bt
\[ \langle \hat{H} \rangle = E^{\mathrm{HF}}= \langle \Phi_0 | \hat{H}|\Phi_0 \rangle
\]
!et
that is to find a local minimum with a Slater determinant $\Phi_0$ being the ansatz for the ground state. 
 *  The variational principle ensures that $E^{\mathrm{HF}} \ge E_0$, with $E_0$ the exact ground state energy.

===== Why Hartree-Fock?  =====
!bblock
We will show that the Hartree-Fock Hamiltonian $\hat{h}^{\mathrm{HF}}$ equals our definition of the operator $\hat{f}$ discussed in connection with the new definition of the normal-ordered Hamiltonian (see later lectures), that is we have, for a specific matrix element
!bt
\[
\langle p |\hat{h}^{\mathrm{HF}}| q \rangle =\langle p |\hat{f}| q \rangle=\langle p|\hat{t}+\hat{u}_{\mathrm{ext}}|q \rangle +\sum_{i\le F} \langle pi | \hat{V} | qi\rangle_{AS},
\]
!et
meaning that
!bt
\[
\langle p|\hat{u}^{\mathrm{HF}}|q\rangle = \sum_{i\le F} \langle pi | \hat{V} | qi\rangle_{AS}.
\]
!et
The so-called Hartree-Fock potential $\hat{u}^{\mathrm{HF}}$ brings an explicit medium dependence due to the summation over all single-particle states below the Fermi level $F$. It brings also in an explicit dependence on the two-body interaction (in nuclear physics we can also have complicated three- or higher-body forces). The two-body interaction, with its contribution from the other bystanding fermions, creates an effective mean field in which a given fermion moves, in addition to the external potential $\hat{u}_{\mathrm{ext}}$ which confines the motion of the fermion. For systems like nuclei, there is no external confining potential. Nuclei are examples of self-bound systems, where the binding arises due to the intrinsic nature of the strong force. For nuclear systems thus, there would be no external one-body potential in the Hartree-Fock Hamiltonian.

===== Definitions and notations =====
!bblock
Before we proceed we need some definitions.
We will assume that the interacting part of the Hamiltonian
can be approximated by a two-body interaction.
This means that our Hamiltonian is written as the sum of some onebody part and a twobody part
!bt
\begin{equation}
    \hat{H} = \hat{H}_0 + \hat{H}_I 
    = \sum_{i=1}^A \hat{h}_0(x_i) + \sum_{i < j}^A \hat{v}(r_{ij}),
label{Hnuclei}
\end{equation}
!et
with 
!bt
\begin{equation}
  H_0=\sum_{i=1}^A \hat{h}_0(x_i).
label{hinuclei}
\end{equation}
!et
The onebody part $u_{\mathrm{ext}}(x_i)$ is normally approximated by a harmonic oscillator or Woods-Saxon potential or for electronic systems the Coulomb interaction an electron feels from the nucleus. However, other potentials are fully possible, such as 
one derived from the self-consistent solution of the Hartree-Fock equations to be discussed here.
!eblock

===== Definitions and notations =====
!bblock
Our Hamiltonian is invariant under the permutation (interchange) of two particles.
Since we deal with fermions however, the total wave function is antisymmetric.
Let $\hat{P}$ be an operator which interchanges two particles.
Due to the symmetries we have ascribed to our Hamiltonian, this operator commutes with the total Hamiltonian,
!bt 
\[
[\hat{H},\hat{P}] = 0,
 \]
!et
meaning that $\Psi_{\lambda}(x_1, x_2, \dots , x_A)$ is an eigenfunction of 
$\hat{P}$ as well, that is
!bt 
\[
\hat{P}_{ij}\Psi_{\lambda}(x_1, x_2, \dots,x_i,\dots,x_j,\dots,x_A)=
\beta\Psi_{\lambda}(x_1, x_2, \dots,x_i,\dots,x_j,\dots,x_A),
\]
!et
where $\beta$ is the eigenvalue of $\hat{P}$. We have introduced the suffix $ij$ in order to indicate that we permute particles $i$ and $j$.
The Pauli principle tells us that the total wave function for a system of fermions
has to be antisymmetric, resulting in the eigenvalue $\beta = -1$.   
!eblock

!split
===== Definitions and notations =====
!bblock
In our case we assume that  we can approximate the exact eigenfunction with a Slater determinant
!bt
\begin{equation}
   \Phi(x_1, x_2,\dots ,x_A,\alpha,\beta,\dots, \sigma)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{A!}}
\left| \begin{array}{ccccc} \psi_{\alpha}(x_1)& \psi_{\alpha}(x_2)& \dots & \dots & \psi_{\alpha}(x_A)\\
                            \psi_{\beta}(x_1)&\psi_{\beta}(x_2)& \dots & \dots & \psi_{\beta}(x_A)\\  
                            \dots & \dots & \dots & \dots & \dots \\
                            \dots & \dots & \dots & \dots & \dots \\
                     \psi_{\sigma}(x_1)&\psi_{\sigma}(x_2)& \dots & \dots & \psi_{\sigma}(x_A)\end{array} \right|, label{eq:HartreeFockDet}
\end{equation}
!et
where  $x_i$  stand for the coordinates and spin values of a particle $i$ and $\alpha,\beta,\dots, \gamma$ 
are quantum numbers needed to describe remaining quantum numbers.  
!eblock

!split
===== Definitions and notations =====
!bblock
The single-particle function $\psi_{\alpha}(x_i)$  are eigenfunctions of the onebody
Hamiltonian $h_i$, that is
!bt 
\[
\hat{h}_0(x_i)=\hat{t}(x_i) + \hat{u}_{\mathrm{ext}}(x_i),
\]
!et
with eigenvalues 
!bt 
\[
\hat{h}_0(x_i) \psi_{\alpha}(x_i)=\left(\hat{t}(x_i) + \hat{u}_{\mathrm{ext}}(x_i)\right)\psi_{\alpha}(x_i)=\varepsilon_{\alpha}\psi_{\alpha}(x_i).
\]
!et
The energies $\varepsilon_{\alpha}$ are the so-called non-interacting single-particle energies, or unperturbed energies. 
The total energy is in this case the sum over all  single-particle energies, if no two-body or more complicated
many-body interactions are present.
!eblock

!split
===== Definitions and notations =====
!bblock
Let us denote the ground state energy by $E_0$. According to the
variational principle we have
!bt
\[
  E_0 \le E[\Phi] = \int \Phi^*\hat{H}\Phi d\mathbf{\tau}
\]
!et
where $\Phi$ is a trial function which we assume to be normalized
!bt
\[
  \int \Phi^*\Phi d\mathbf{\tau} = 1,
\]
!et
where we have used the shorthand $d\mathbf{\tau}=dx_1dr_2\dots dr_A$.

===== Brief reminder on some linear algebra properties =====
!bblock
Before we proceed with a more compact representation of a Slater determinant, we would like to repeat some linear algebra properties which will be useful for our derivations of the energy as function of a Slater determinant, Hartree-Fock theory and later the nuclear shell model.

The inverse of a matrix is defined by

!bt
\[
\mathbf{A}^{-1} \cdot \mathbf{A} = I
\]
!et
A unitary matrix $\mathbf{A}$ is one whose inverse is its adjoint
!bt
\[
\mathbf{A}^{-1}=\mathbf{A}^{\dagger}
\]
!et
A real unitary matrix is called orthogonal and its inverse is equal to its transpose.
A hermitian matrix is its own self-adjoint, that  is
!bt
\[
\mathbf{A}=\mathbf{A}^{\dagger}. 
\]

===== Basic Matrix Features =====
!bblock
Since we will deal with Fermions (identical and indistinguishable particles) we will 
form an ansatz for a given state in terms of so-called Slater determinants determined
by a chosen basis of single-particle functions. 

For a given $n\times n$ matrix $\mathbf{A}$ we can write its determinant
!bt
\[
   det(\mathbf{A})=|\mathbf{A}|=
\left| \begin{array}{ccccc} a_{11}& a_{12}& \dots & \dots & a_{1n}\\
                            a_{21}&a_{22}& \dots & \dots & a_{2n}\\  
                            \dots & \dots & \dots & \dots & \dots \\
                            \dots & \dots & \dots & \dots & \dots \\
                            a_{n1}& a_{n2}& \dots & \dots & a_{nn}\end{array} \right|,
\]
!et
in a more compact form as 
!bt
\[
|\mathbf{A}|= \sum_{i=1}^{n!}(-1)^{p_i}\hat{P}_i a_{11}a_{22}\dots a_{nn},
\]
!et
where $\hat{P}_i$ is a permutation operator which permutes the column indices $1,2,3,\dots,n$
and the sum runs over all $n!$ permutations.  The quantity $p_i$ represents the number of transpositions of column indices that are needed in order to bring a given permutation back to its initial ordering, in our case given by $a_{11}a_{22}\dots a_{nn}$ here.
!eblock


!split
===== Basic Matrix Features, simple $2 \times 2$ determinant  =====
!bblock
A simple $2\times 2$ determinant illustrates this. We have
!bt
\[
   det(\mathbf{A})=
\left| \begin{array}{cc} a_{11}& a_{12}\\
                            a_{21}&a_{22}\end{array} \right|= (-1)^0a_{11}a_{22}+(-1)^1a_{12}a_{21},
\]
!et
where in the last term we have interchanged the column indices $1$ and $2$. The natural ordering we have chosen is $a_{11}a_{22}$. 
!eblock



!split
===== Definitions and notations =====
!bblock
With the above we can rewrite our Slater determinant in a more compact form.
In the Hartree-Fock method the trial function is the Slater
determinant of Eq.~(ref{eq:HartreeFockDet}) which can be rewritten as 
!bt
\[
  \Phi(x_1,x_2,\dots,x_A,\alpha,\beta,\dots,\nu) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{A!}}\sum_{P} (-)^P\hat{P}\psi_{\alpha}(x_1)
    \psi_{\beta}(x_2)\dots\psi_{\nu}(x_A)=\sqrt{A!}\hat{A}\Phi_H,
\]
!et
where we have introduced the antisymmetrization operator $\hat{A}$ defined by the 
summation over all possible permutations of two particles.
!eblock

!split
===== Definitions and notations =====
!bblock
It is defined as
!bt
\begin{equation}
  \hat{A} = \frac{1}{A!}\sum_{p} (-)^p\hat{P},
label{antiSymmetryOperator}
\end{equation}
!et
with $p$ standing for the number of permutations. We have introduced for later use the so-called
Hartree-function, defined by the simple product of all possible single-particle functions
!bt
\[
  \Phi_H(x_1,x_2,\dots,x_A,\alpha,\beta,\dots,\nu) =
  \psi_{\alpha}(x_1)
    \psi_{\beta}(x_2)\dots\psi_{\nu}(x_A).
\]
!et
!eblock

!split
===== Definitions and notations =====
!bblock
Both $\hat{H}_0$ and $\hat{H}_I$ are invariant under all possible permutations of any two particles
and hence commute with $\hat{A}$
!bt
\begin{equation}
  [H_0,\hat{A}] = [H_I,\hat{A}] = 0. label{commutionAntiSym}
\end{equation}
!et
Furthermore, $\hat{A}$ satisfies
!bt
\begin{equation}
  \hat{A}^2 = \hat{A},  label{AntiSymSquared}
\end{equation}
!et
since every permutation of the Slater
determinant reproduces it. 
!eblock

!split
===== Definitions and notations =====
!bblock
The expectation value of $\hat{H}_0$ 
!bt
\[
  \int \Phi^*\hat{H}_0\Phi d\mathbf{\tau} 
  = A! \int \Phi_H^*\hat{A}\hat{H}_0\hat{A}\Phi_H d\mathbf{\tau}
\]
!et
is readily reduced to
!bt
\[
  \int \Phi^*\hat{H}_0\Phi d\mathbf{\tau} 
  = A! \int \Phi_H^*\hat{H}_0\hat{A}\Phi_H d\mathbf{\tau},
\]
!et
where we have used Eqs.~(ref{commutionAntiSym}) and
(ref{AntiSymSquared}). The next step is to replace the antisymmetrization
operator by its definition and to
replace $\hat{H}_0$ with the sum of one-body operators
!bt
\[
  \int \Phi^*\hat{H}_0\Phi  d\mathbf{\tau}
  = \sum_{i=1}^A \sum_{p} (-)^p\int 
  \Phi_H^*\hat{h}_0\hat{P}\Phi_H d\mathbf{\tau}.
\]
!et
!eblock

!split
===== Definitions and notations =====
!bblock
The integral vanishes if two or more particles are permuted in only one
of the Hartree-functions $\Phi_H$ because the individual single-particle wave functions are
orthogonal. We obtain then
!bt
\[
  \int \Phi^*\hat{H}_0\Phi  d\mathbf{\tau}= \sum_{i=1}^A \int \Phi_H^*\hat{h}_0\Phi_H  d\mathbf{\tau}.
\]
!et
Orthogonality of the single-particle functions allows us to further simplify the integral, and we
arrive at the following expression for the expectation values of the
sum of one-body Hamiltonians 
!bt
\begin{equation}
  \int \Phi^*\hat{H}_0\Phi  d\mathbf{\tau}
  = \sum_{\mu=1}^A \int \psi_{\mu}^*(x)\hat{h}_0\psi_{\mu}(x)dx.
  label{H1Expectation}
\end{equation}
!et
!eblock

!split
===== Definitions and notations =====
!bblock
We introduce the following shorthand for the above integral
!bt
\[
\langle \mu | \hat{h}_0 | \mu \rangle = \int \psi_{\mu}^*(x)\hat{h}_0\psi_{\mu}(x)dx,
\]
!et
and rewrite Eq.~(ref{H1Expectation}) as
!bt
\begin{equation}
  \int \Phi^*\hat{H}_0\Phi  d\tau
  = \sum_{\mu=1}^A \langle \mu | \hat{h}_0 | \mu \rangle.
  label{H1Expectation1}
\end{equation}
!et
!eblock

!split
===== Definitions and notations =====
!bblock
The expectation value of the two-body part of the Hamiltonian is obtained in a
similar manner. We have
!bt
\[
  \int \Phi^*\hat{H}_I\Phi d\mathbf{\tau} 
  = A! \int \Phi_H^*\hat{A}\hat{H}_I\hat{A}\Phi_H d\mathbf{\tau},
\]
!et
which reduces to
!bt
\[
 \int \Phi^*\hat{H}_I\Phi d\mathbf{\tau} 
  = \sum_{i\le j=1}^A \sum_{p} (-)^p\int 
  \Phi_H^*\hat{v}(r_{ij})\hat{P}\Phi_H d\mathbf{\tau},
\]
!et
by following the same arguments as for the one-body
Hamiltonian. 
!eblock

!split
===== Definitions and notations =====
!bblock
Because of the dependence on the inter-particle distance $r_{ij}$,  permutations of
any two particles no longer vanish, and we get
!bt
\[
  \int \Phi^*\hat{H}_I\Phi d\mathbf{\tau} 
  = \sum_{i < j=1}^A \int  
  \Phi_H^*\hat{v}(r_{ij})(1-P_{ij})\Phi_H d\mathbf{\tau}.
\]
!et
where $P_{ij}$ is the permutation operator that interchanges
particle $i$ and particle $j$. Again we use the assumption that the single-particle wave functions
are orthogonal. 
!eblock


!split
===== Definitions and notations =====
!bblock
We obtain
!bt
\begin{align}
  \int \Phi^*\hat{H}_I\Phi d\mathbf{\tau} 
  = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{\mu=1}^A\sum_{\nu=1}^A
    &\left[ \int \psi_{\mu}^*(x_i)\psi_{\nu}^*(x_j)\hat{v}(r_{ij})\psi_{\mu}(x_i)\psi_{\nu}(x_j)
    dx_idx_j \right.\\
  &\left.
  - \int \psi_{\mu}^*(x_i)\psi_{\nu}^*(x_j)
  \hat{v}(r_{ij})\psi_{\nu}(x_i)\psi_{\mu}(x_j)
  dx_idx_j
  \right]. label{H2Expectation}
\end{align}
!et
The first term is the so-called direct term. It gives rise to the  Hartree term in Hartree-Fock theory, 
while the second is due to the Pauli principle and is called
the exchange term and gives rise to the Fock term in the Hartree-Fock equations.
The factor  $1/2$ is introduced because we now run over
all pairs twice. 
!eblock

!split
===== Definitions and notations =====
!bblock
The last equation allows us to  introduce some further definitions.  
The single-particle wave functions $\psi_{\mu}(x)$, defined by the quantum numbers $\mu$ and $x$
are defined as the overlap 
!bt
\[
   \psi_{\mu}(x)  = \langle x | \mu \rangle .
\]
!et
!eblock

!split
===== Definitions and notations =====
!bblock
We introduce the following shorthands for the above two integrals
!bt
\[
\langle \mu\nu|\hat{v}|\mu\nu\rangle =  \int \psi_{\mu}^*(x_i)\psi_{\nu}^*(x_j)\hat{v}(r_{ij})\psi_{\mu}(x_i)\psi_{\nu}(x_j)
    dx_idx_j,
\]
!et
and
!bt 
\[
\langle \mu\nu|\hat{v}|\nu\mu\rangle = \int \psi_{\mu}^*(x_i)\psi_{\nu}^*(x_j)
  \hat{v}(r_{ij})\psi_{\nu}(x_i)\psi_{\mu}(x_j)
  dx_idx_j.  
\]
!et
!eblock




!split
===== Compact functional =====
!bblock
Our functional can then be  written in a compact version as
!bt
\[
  E[\Phi] 
  = \sum_{\mu}^A \langle \mu | \hat{h}_0 | \mu\rangle+ \frac{1}{2}\sum_{\mu\nu}^A\left[\langle \mu\nu |\hat{v}|\mu\nu\rangle-\langle \nu\mu |\hat{v}|\mu\nu\rangle\right].
\]
!et
!eblock

!split
===== Properties of the interaction elements =====
!bblock
Since the interaction is invariant under the interchange of two particles it means for example that we have
!bt
\[
\langle \mu\nu|\hat{v}|\mu\nu\rangle =  \langle \nu\mu|\hat{v}|\nu\mu\rangle,  
\]
!et
or in the more general case
!bt
\[
\langle \mu\nu|\hat{v}|\sigma\tau\rangle =  \langle \nu\mu|\hat{v}|\tau\sigma\rangle.  
\]
!et
!eblock

!split
===== Redefining the matrix elements =====
!bblock
The direct and exchange matrix elements can be  brought together if we define the antisymmetrized matrix element
!bt
\[
\langle \mu\nu|\hat{v}|\mu\nu\rangle_{AS}= \langle \mu\nu|\hat{v}|\mu\nu\rangle-\langle \mu\nu|\hat{v}|\nu\mu\rangle,
\]
!et
or for a general matrix element  
!bt
\[
\langle \mu\nu|\hat{v}|\sigma\tau\rangle_{AS}= \langle \mu\nu|\hat{v}|\sigma\tau\rangle-\langle \mu\nu|\hat{v}|\tau\sigma\rangle.
\]
!et
It has the symmetry property
!bt
\[
\langle \mu\nu|\hat{v}|\sigma\tau\rangle_{AS}= -\langle \mu\nu|\hat{v}|\tau\sigma\rangle_{AS}=-\langle \nu\mu|\hat{v}|\sigma\tau\rangle_{AS}.
\]
!et
The antisymmetric matrix element is also hermitian, implying 
!bt
\[
\langle \mu\nu|\hat{v}|\sigma\tau\rangle_{AS}= \langle \sigma\tau|\hat{v}|\mu\nu\rangle_{AS}.
\]
!et
!eblock

!split
===== Rewriting the energy functional =====
!bblock
With these notations we rewrite the energy functional as
!bt
\begin{equation}
  \int \Phi^*\hat{H_I}\Phi d\mathbf{\tau} 
  = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{\mu=1}^A\sum_{\nu=1}^A \langle \mu\nu|\hat{v}|\mu\nu\rangle_{AS}. label{H2Expectation2}
\end{equation}
!et

Adding the contribution from the one-body operator $\hat{H}_0$ to
(ref{H2Expectation2}) we obtain the energy functional 
!bt
\begin{equation}
  E[\Phi] 
  = \sum_{\mu=1}^A \langle \mu | h | \mu \rangle +
  \frac{1}{2}\sum_{{\mu}=1}^A\sum_{{\nu}=1}^A \langle \mu\nu|\hat{v}|\mu\nu\rangle_{AS}. label{FunctionalEPhi}
\end{equation}
!et 
In our coordinate space derivations below we will spell out the Hartree-Fock equations in terms of their integrals.

===== Reminder on Variational Calculus and Lagrangian Multipliers  =====
!bblock 
The calculus of variations involves 
problems where the quantity to be minimized or maximized is an integral. 

In the general case we have an integral of the type
!bt
\[ 
E[\Phi]= \int_a^b f(\Phi(x),\frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial x},x)dx,
\]
!et
where $E$ is the quantity which is sought minimized or maximized.
The problem is that although $f$ is a function of the variables $\Phi$, $\partial \Phi/\partial x$ and $x$, the exact dependence of
$\Phi$ on $x$ is not known.  This means again that even though the integral has fixed limits $a$ and $b$, the path of integration is
not known. In our case the unknown quantities are the single-particle wave functions and we wish to choose an integration path which makes
the functional $E[\Phi]$ stationary. This means that we want to find minima, or maxima or saddle points. In physics we search normally for minima.
Our task is therefore to find the minimum of $E[\Phi]$ so that its variation $\delta E$ is zero  subject to specific
constraints. In our case the constraints appear as the integral which expresses the orthogonality of the  single-particle wave functions.
The constraints can be treated via the technique of Lagrangian multipliers
!eblock


!split
===== Variational Calculus and Lagrangian Multipliers, simple example  =====
!bblock 
Let us specialize to the expectation value of the energy for one particle in three-dimensions.
This expectation value reads
!bt
\[
  E=\int dxdydz \psi^*(x,y,z) \hat{H} \psi(x,y,z),
\]
!et
with the constraint
!bt
\[
 \int dxdydz \psi^*(x,y,z) \psi(x,y,z)=1,
\]
!et
and a Hamiltonian
!bt
\[
\hat{H}=-\frac{1}{2}\nabla^2+V(x,y,z).
\]
!et
We will, for the sake of notational convenience,  skip the variables $x,y,z$ below, and write for example $V(x,y,z)=V$.
!eblock

!split
===== Manipulating terms  =====
!bblock 
The integral involving the kinetic energy can be written as, with the function $\psi$ vanishing
strongly for large values of $x,y,z$ (given here by the limits $a$ and $b$), 
!bt
 \[
  \int_a^b dxdydz \psi^* \left(-\frac{1}{2}\nabla^2\right) \psi dxdydz = \psi^*\nabla\psi|_a^b+\int_a^b dxdydz\frac{1}{2}\nabla\psi^*\nabla\psi.
\]
!et
We will drop the limits $a$ and $b$ in the remaining discussion. 
Inserting this expression into the expectation value for the energy and taking the variational minimum  we obtain
!bt
\[
\delta E = \delta \left\{\int dxdydz\left( \frac{1}{2}\nabla\psi^*\nabla\psi+V\psi^*\psi\right)\right\} = 0.
\]
!et
!eblock

!split
===== Adding the Lagrangian multiplier  =====
!bblock 
The constraint appears in integral form as 
!bt
\[
 \int dxdydz \psi^* \psi=\mathrm{constant},
\]
!et
and multiplying with a Lagrangian multiplier $\lambda$ and taking the variational minimum we obtain the final variational equation
!bt
\[
\delta \left\{\int dxdydz\left( \frac{1}{2}\nabla\psi^*\nabla\psi+V\psi^*\psi-\lambda\psi^*\psi\right)\right\} = 0.
\]
!et
We introduce the function  $f$
!bt
\[
  f =  \frac{1}{2}\nabla\psi^*\nabla\psi+V\psi^*\psi-\lambda\psi^*\psi=
\frac{1}{2}(\psi^*_x\psi_x+\psi^*_y\psi_y+\psi^*_z\psi_z)+V\psi^*\psi-\lambda\psi^*\psi,

===== Hartree-Fock by varying the coefficients of a wave function expansion =====
!bblock
In deriving the Hartree-Fock equations, we  will expand the single-particle functions in a known basis  and vary the coefficients, 
that is, the new single-particle wave function is written as a linear expansion
in terms of a fixed chosen orthogonal basis (for example the well-known harmonic oscillator functions or the hydrogen-like functions etc).
We define our new Hartree-Fock single-particle basis by performing a unitary transformation 
on our previous basis (labelled with greek indices) as
!bt
\begin{equation}
\psi_p^{HF}  = \sum_{\lambda} C_{p\lambda}\phi_{\lambda}. label{eq:newbasis}
\end{equation}
!et
In this case we vary the coefficients $C_{p\lambda}$. If the basis has infinitely many solutions, we need
to truncate the above sum.  We assume that the basis $\phi_{\lambda}$ is orthogonal. A unitary transformation keeps the orthogonality, as discussed in exercise 1 below.

===== More on linear algebra  =====
!bblock
In the previous slide we stated that a unitary transformation keeps the orthogonality, as discussed in exercise 1 below.  To see this consider first a basis of vectors $\mathbf{v}_i$,
!bt
\[
\mathbf{v}_i = \begin{bmatrix} v_{i1} \\ \dots \\ \dots \\v_{in} \end{bmatrix}
\]
!et
We assume that the basis is orthogonal, that is 
!bt
\[
\mathbf{v}_j^T\mathbf{v}_i = \delta_{ij}.
\]
!et
An orthogonal or unitary transformation
!bt
\[
\mathbf{w}_i=\mathbf{U}\mathbf{v}_i,
\]
!et
preserves the dot product and orthogonality since
!bt
\[
\mathbf{w}_j^T\mathbf{w}_i=(\mathbf{U}\mathbf{v}_j)^T\mathbf{U}\mathbf{v}_i=\mathbf{v}_j^T\mathbf{U}^T\mathbf{U}\mathbf{v}_i= \mathbf{v}_j^T\mathbf{v}_i = \delta_{ij}.

=====  Coefficients of a wave function expansion =====
!bblock
This means that if the coefficients $C_{p\lambda}$ belong to a unitary or orthogonal trasformation (using the Dirac bra-ket notation)
!bt
\[
\vert p\rangle  = \sum_{\lambda} C_{p\lambda}\vert\lambda\rangle,
\]
!et
orthogonality is preserved, that is $\langle \alpha \vert \beta\rangle = \delta_{\alpha\beta}$
and $\langle p \vert q\rangle = \delta_{pq}$. 

This propertry is extremely useful when we build up a basis of many-body Stater determinant based states. 

_Note also that although a basis $\vert \alpha\rangle$ contains an infinity of states, for practical calculations we have always to make some truncations._

As an example, consider a simple model for atomic sodium, Na. Neutral sodium has eleven electrons, 
with the weakest bound one being confined the $3s$ single-particle quantum numbers. The energy needed to remove an electron from neutral sodium is rather small, 5.1391 eV, a feature which pertains to all alkali metals.
Having performed a  Hartree-Fock calculation for neutral sodium would then allows us to compute the
ionization energy by using the single-particle energy for the $3s$ states, namely $\epsilon_{3s}^{\mathrm{HF}}$. 

From these considerations, we see that Hartree-Fock theory allows us to make a connection between experimental 
observables (here ionization and affinity energies) and the underlying interactions between particles.  
In this sense, we are now linking the dynamics and structure of a many-body system with the laws of motion which govern the system. Our approach is a reductionistic one, meaning that we want to understand the laws of motion 
in terms of the particles or degrees of freedom which we believe are the fundamental ones. Our Slater determinant, being constructed as the product of various single-particle functions, follows this philosophy.

===== Developing a  Hartree-Fock program  =====

Neutron drops are a powerful theoretical laboratory for testing,
validating and improving nuclear structure models. Indeed, all
approaches to nuclear structure, from ab initio theory to shell model
to density functional theory are applicable in such systems. We will,
therefore, use neutron drops as a test system for setting up a
Hartree-Fock code.  This program can later be extended to studies of
the binding energy of nuclei like $^{16}$O or $^{40}$Ca. The
single-particle energies obtained by solving the Hartree-Fock
equations can then be directly related to experimental separation
energies. For those of you interested in such studies, the program you
will end up developing here can be used in later projects, with simple
extensions.  Since Hartree-Fock theory is the starting point for
several many-body techniques (density functional theory, random-phase
approximation, shell-model etc), the aim here is to develop a computer
program to solve the Hartree-Fock equations in a given single-particle basis,
here the harmonic oscillator.

!split
===== Developing a  Hartree-Fock program for neutron drops (easy to include protons) =====
The Hamiltonian for a system of $N$ neutron drops confined in a
harmonic potential reads
!bt
\[
\hat{H} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{\hat{p}_{i}^{2}}{2m}+\sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{1}{2} m\omega {r}_{i}^{2}+\sum_{i<j} \hat{V}_{ij},
\]
!et
with $\hbar^{2}/2m = 20.73$ fm$^{2}$, $mc^{2} = 938.90590$ MeV, and 
$\hat{V}_{ij}$ is the two-body interaction potential whose 
matrix elements are precalculated
and to be read in by you.


!split
===== Developing a  Hartree-Fock program, the algorithm   =====
The Hartree-Fock algorithm can be broken down as follows. We recall that  our Hartree-Fock matrix  is 
!bt
\[
\hat{h}_{\alpha\beta}^{HF}=\langle \alpha \vert\hat{h}_0 \vert \beta \rangle+
\sum_{j=1}^N\sum_{\gamma\delta} C^*_{j\gamma}C_{j\delta}\langle \alpha\gamma|V|\beta\delta\rangle_{AS}.
\]
!et
Normally we assume that the single-particle basis $\vert\beta\rangle$
forms an eigenbasis for the operator $\hat{h}_0$ (this is our case), meaning that the
Hartree-Fock matrix becomes
!bt
\[
\hat{h}_{\alpha\beta}^{HF}=\epsilon_{\alpha}\delta_{\alpha,\beta}+
\sum_{j=1}^N\sum_{\gamma\delta} C^*_{j\gamma}C_{j\delta}\langle \alpha\gamma|V|\beta\delta\rangle_{AS}.
\]
!et
The Hartree-Fock eigenvalue problem
!bt
\[
\sum_{\beta}\hat{h}_{\alpha\beta}^{HF}C_{i\beta}=\epsilon_i^{\mathrm{HF}}C_{i\alpha},
\]
!et
can be written out in a more compact form as
!bt
\[
\hat{h}^{HF}\hat{C}=\epsilon^{\mathrm{HF}}\hat{C}. 
\]
!et

!split
===== Developing a  Hartree-Fock program, the density matrix  =====

The equations are often rewritten in terms of a so-called density matrix,
which is defined as 
!bt
\begin{equation}
\rho_{\gamma\delta}=\sum_{i=1}^{N}\langle\gamma|i\rangle\langle i|\delta\rangle = \sum_{i=1}^{N}C_{i\gamma}C^*_{i\delta}.
\end{equation}
!et
It means that we can rewrite the Hartree-Fock Hamiltonian as
!bt
\[
\hat{h}_{\alpha\beta}^{HF}=\epsilon_{\alpha}\delta_{\alpha,\beta}+
\sum_{\gamma\delta} \rho_{\gamma\delta}\langle \alpha\gamma|V|\beta\delta\rangle_{AS}.
\]
!et
It is convenient to use the density matrix since we can precalculate in every iteration the product of two eigenvector components $C$. 

!split
===== Developing a  Hartree-Fock program, additional considerations  =====

Note that $\langle \alpha\vert\hat{h}_0\vert\beta \rangle$ denotes the
matrix elements of the one-body part of the starting hamiltonian. For
self-bound nuclei $\langle \alpha\vert\hat{h}_0\vert\beta \rangle$ is the
kinetic energy, whereas for neutron drops, $\langle \alpha \vert \hat{h}_0 \vert \beta \rangle$ represents the harmonic oscillator hamiltonian since
the system is confined in a harmonic trap. If we are working in a
harmonic oscillator basis with the same $\omega$ as the trapping
potential, then $\langle \alpha\vert\hat{h}_0 \vert \beta \rangle$ is
diagonal.


!split
===== "Developing a  Hartree-Fock program, a simple Python program":"https://github.com/NuclearTalent/NuclearStructure/tree/master/doc/Programs/HFcode"  =====

An example of a function written in python which performs the Hartree-Fock calculation is shown here. In setting up your code you will need to write a function which sets up the single-particle basis, the matrix elements $t_{\alpha\gamma}$ of the one-body operator (called $h0$ in the function below) and the antisymmetrized TBMEs (called *nninteraction* in the code link below) and the density matrix elements $\rho_{\beta\delta}$ (called *densityMatrix* below). 
The python program  shows how one can, in a brute force way read in matrix elements in $m$-scheme and compute the Hartree-Fock single-particle energies for four major shells. The interaction which has been used is the so-called N3LO interaction of "Machleidt and Entem":"http://journals.aps.org/prc/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevC.68.041001"
using the "Similarity Renormalization Group":"http://journals.aps.org/prc/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevC.75.061001" approach method to renormalize the interaction, using an oscillator energy $\hbar\omega=10$ MeV. 

The nucleon-nucleon two-body matrix elements are in $m$-scheme and are fully anti-symmetrized. The Hartree-Fock programs uses the density matrix discussed above in order to compute the Hartree-Fock matrix.
Here we display the Hartree-Fock part only, assuming that single-particle data and two-body matrix elements have already been read in. 

!split
===== Developing a  Hartree-Fock program, a simple Python program and input files =====


The input file spdata.dat contains the information of all single-particle quantum numbers needed to define this space. In total we have $40$ single-particle states labeled by $n$, $j$, $l$ and $m$, where $m$ is the projection of the total single-particle angular momentum $j$. To every set of single-particle quantum numbers there is a unique number $p$ identifiying them, meaning that the two-body matrix elements in the file twobody.dat are identified as 
$\langle pq \vert \hat{v}\vert rs \rangle$.

You will need to read these two files and set up arrays which store the matrix elements while running the program.

===== Developing a  Hartree-Fock program, analyzing the results =====

Running the program, one finds that the lowest-lying states for a nucleus like ${}^{16}\mbox{O}$, we see that the nucleon-nucleon force brings a natural spin-orbit splitting for the $0p$ states (or other states except the $s$-states).
Since we are using the $m$-scheme for our calculations, we observe that there are several states with the same
eigenvalues. The number of eigenvalues corresponds to the degeneracy $2j+1$ and is well respected in our calculations, as see from the table here.

The values of the lowest-lying states are ($\pi$ for protons and $\nu$ for neutrons)

===== Developing a  Hartree-Fock program, separation energies =====

We can use these results to attempt our first link with experimental data, namely to compute the shell gap or the separation energies. The shell gap for neutrons is given by
!bt
\[
\Delta S_n= 2BE(N,Z)-BE(N-1,Z)-BE(N+1,Z).
\]
!et
For ${}^{16}\mbox{O}$  we have an experimental value for the  shell gap of $11.51$ MeV for neutrons, while our Hartree-Fock calculations result in $25.65$ MeV. This means that correlations beyond a simple Hartree-Fock calculation with a two-body force play an important role in nuclear physics.
The splitting between the $0p_{3/2}^{\nu}$ and the $0p_{1/2}^{\nu}$ state is 4.88 MeV, while the experimental value for the gap between the ground state $1/2^{-}$ and the first excited $3/2^{-}$ states is 6.08 MeV. The two-nucleon spin-orbit force plays a central role here. In our discussion of nuclear forces we will see how the spin-orbit force comes into play here.

!split
===== Analyzing the results in terms of the nuclear force components  =====


Our Hamiltonian contains one-body, two-body and three-body contributions and in 
the equations below, we  label states below the Fermi level $F$ as $i,j,\ldots$ while states 
above the Fermi level are defined by $a,b,\ldots$. General single-particle states
are given by the letters  $p,q \dots$. The
quantities $pq\dots$ represent the quantum numbers of various
single-particle states, namely
$p=(n_p,l_p,j_p,m_{j_p},t_{z_p})$.   
The commutation relations for creation and annihilations operators with respect to
a given reference state are then given by

!bt
\begin{equation*}
   \left\{a_p^\dagger, a_q \right\}= \delta_{pq}, p, q \leq F \hspace{0.5cm} \left\{a_p, a_q^\dagger \right\} =
        \delta_{pq}, p, q > F.
\end{equation*}
!et


!split
===== Reminder on definitions  =====
The action of the creation and annihilation operators with respect to a reference state $\Phi_0$ are then given by
 $a_i|\Phi_0\rangle = |\Phi_i\rangle$ where a state labeled by $|\Phi_i\rangle$ means that a particle in a 
single-particle state $i$ has been removed. Similarly, we have $a_a^\dagger|\Phi_0\rangle = |\Phi^a\rangle$, $a_i^\dagger|\Phi_0\rangle = 0$ 
and $a_a|\Phi_0\rangle = 0$.  With the above definitions, we write our Hamiltonian as

!bt
\begin{equation*}
\hat{H}=\hat{H}_0+\hat{V}+\hat{W},
\end{equation*}
!et
where 
the single-particle part is given by

!bt
\begin{equation*}
    \hat{H}_0 = \sum_{pq} \langle p|\hat{h}_0|q\rangle a_p^\dagger a_q.
 \end{equation*}
!et

!split
===== A general Hamiltonian  =====
This part of the Hamiltonian is commonly defined in terms of some external potential like the three-dimensional 
harmonic oscillator or a particular mean-field basis. 
Similarly, the two-body part of the Hamiltonian
is given by

!bt
\begin{equation*}
  \hat{V} = \frac{1}{4}\sum_{pqrs} \langle pq|\hat{v}|rs\rangle_{\mathrm{AS}} a_p^\dagger a_q^\dagger a_s a_r
\end{equation*}
!et
where we have employed antisymmetric matrix elements defined as

!bt
\begin{equation*}
\langle pq|\hat{v}|rs\rangle_{\mathrm{AS}}=\langle pq|\hat{v}|rs\rangle-\langle pq|\hat{v}|sr\rangle.
\end{equation*}
!et
We will assume that the  two-body operator $\hat{v}$ is given by a nucleon-nucleon interaction.

!split
===== Adding a three-body interaction  =====
Finally, the three-body part of our Hamiltonian operator  is defined by

!bt
\begin{equation*}
   \hat{W} =\frac{1}{36} \sum_{pqrstu} \langle pqr|\hat{w}|stu\rangle_{\mathrm{AS}}a_p^\dagger a_q^\dagger a_r^\dagger a_u a_t a_s,
\end{equation*}
!et
where we have defined the antisymmetric matrix elements

!bt
\begin{equation*}
          \langle pqr|\hat{w}|stu\rangle_{\mathrm{AS}}= \langle pqr|\hat{w}|stu\rangle + \langle pqr|\hat{w}|tus\rangle + \langle pqr|\hat{w}|ust\rangle- \langle pqr|\hat{w}|sut\rangle - \langle pqr|\hat{w}|tsu\rangle - \langle pqr|\hat{w}|uts\rangle.
\end{equation*}
!et
We will in the discussions to come drop the $\mathrm{AS}$ subscript,
assuming thereby that all matrix elements are antisymmetrized.

!split
===== An additional reminder  =====

Introducing a reference state $|\Phi_0\rangle$ as our new vacuum state
leads to a redefinition of the Hamiltonian in terms of a constant
reference energy $E_0$ defined as

!bt
\begin{equation*}
E_0 = \sum_{i\le F}\langle i | \hat{h}_0|i\rangle+\frac{1}{2}\sum_{ij\le F} \langle ij|\hat{v}|ij\rangle +\frac{1}{6}\sum_{ijk\le F} \langle ijk|\hat{w}|ijk\rangle,
\end{equation*}
!et
and a normal-ordered Hamiltonian

!bt
\begin{equation*}
  \hat{H}_N=\sum_{pq}\langle p|\tilde{f}|q\rangle a^\dagger_p a_q+\frac{1}{4} \sum_{pqrs} \langle pq|\tilde{v}|rs\rangle a^\dagger_p a^\dagger_q a_s  a_r +\frac{1}{36} \sum_{\substack{pqr \\stu}}
                 \langle pqr|\hat{w}|stu\rangle a^\dagger_p a^\dagger_q a^\dagger_r a_u a_t a_s 
\end{equation*}
!et
where

!bt
\begin{equation*}
\langle p| \tilde{f}|q\rangle = \langle p|\hat{h}_0|q\rangle +\sum_{i\le F} \langle pi|\hat{v}|qi\rangle+\frac{1}{2}\sum_{ij\le\alpha_F} \langle pij|\hat{w}|qij\rangle,
\end{equation*}
!et 
represents a correction to the single-particle operator $\hat{h}_0$ due to contributions from the nucleons below the Fermi level.

===== Modification due to a three-body force   =====
The two-body matrix elements are now modified in order to account for medium-modified contributions from the three-body interaction, resulting in

!bt
\begin{equation}
\langle pq|\tilde{v}|rs\rangle=\langle pq|\hat{v}|rs\rangle+\sum_{i\le F} \langle pqi|\hat{w}|rsi\rangle.
label{eq:twobodyveff}
\end{equation}
!et
In Eq. (ref{eq:twobodyveff}), the effective two-body interaction
$\tilde{v}$ can contain both a standard two-nucleon interaction and a
density dependent contribution stemming from a three-body interaction
$\hat{w}$.

!split
===== The monopole term  =====

An important ingredient in studies of effective interactions and their
applications to nuclear structure, is the so-called monopole
interaction, normally defined in terms of a nucleon-nucleon
interaction $\hat{v}$

!bt
\begin{equation}
\bar{V}_{\alpha_p\alpha_q} = \frac{\sum_{J}(2J+1) \langle (\alpha_p\alpha_q)J | \hat{v} | (\alpha_p\alpha_q)J \rangle }{\sum_{J}(2J+1)},
label{eq:monopole1}
\end{equation}
!et
where the total angular momentum of a two-body state $J$ runs over all
possible values.  
In the above equation we have defined a nucleon-nucleon interaction in a so-called angular-momentum 
coupled representation with the symbol $\alpha_{p,q}$ representing all possible quantum numbers except the 
magnetic substates $m_{j_{p,q}}$
The monopole Hamiltonian can be interpreted as an angle-averaged matrix element.  
We have assumed that the single-particle angular momenta $j_p$ and $j_q$ couple to a total
two-particle angular momentum $J$.  The summation over $J$ with the value $2J+1$ can be replaced
by $\sum_J(2J+1)=(2j_p+1)(2j_q+1)$ if $\alpha_p\ne \alpha_q$. If $\alpha_p=\alpha_q$ we can generalize this equation to, assuming that 
our states can represent either protons or neutrons,

!bt
\begin{equation}
\sum_{J}(2J+1)=(2j_p+1)(2j_q+1-\delta_{\alpha_p\alpha_q}).
label{eq:jvalue}
\end{equation}

===== More on the monopole term  =====

The spherical single-particle states,
provide an important ingredient for the formation of shells and
interplay between spherical configurations and deformation in
nuclei. Large shell gaps obtained from a monopole Hamiltonian are a
prerequisite to obtain certain magic numbers. 
Equation (ref{eq:monopole1}) can also be expressed in terms of the
medium-modified two-body interaction defined in
Eq. (ref{eq:twobodyveff}), that is we can have

!bt
\begin{equation}
\tilde{V}_{\alpha_p\alpha_q} = \frac{\sum_{J}(2J+1) \langle (\alpha_p\alpha_q)J | \tilde{v} | (\alpha_p\alpha_q)J \rangle }{\sum_{J}(2J+1)}.
label{eq:monopole2}
\end{equation}

!split
===== Linking the monopole part with Hartree-Fock theory  =====

The single-particle energy $\epsilon_p$ resulting from for example a self-consistent Hartree-Fock field, 
or from  first order in many-body perturbation theory, is given by (in an uncoupled basis)

!bt
\begin{equation*}
\epsilon_p=\langle p| \tilde{f}|p\rangle = \langle p|\hat{h}_0|p\rangle +\sum_{i\le F} \langle pi|\hat{v}|pi\rangle+\frac{1}{2}\sum_{ij\le\alpha_F} \langle pij|\hat{w}|pij\rangle,
\end{equation*}
!et
where we have included the three-body interaction as well.

!split
===== Linking the monopole part with Hartree-Fock theory, angular momentum  =====
We can rewrite this equation in an angular coupled basis ($jj$-coupled basis) as

!bt
\begin{equation}
\epsilon_{\alpha_p}= \langle \alpha_p|\hat{h}_0|\alpha_p\rangle+\frac{1}{2j_p+1}\sum_{\alpha_i\le \alpha_F}\sum_{J} (2J+1)\langle (\alpha_p\alpha_i)J | \hat{v} | (\alpha_p\alpha_i)J \rangle,
label{eq:spequation1}
\end{equation}
!et
or

!bt
\begin{equation}
\epsilon_{\alpha_p}= \langle \alpha_p|\hat{h}_0|\alpha_p\rangle+\frac{1}{2j_p+1}\sum_{\alpha_i\le \alpha_F}\sum_{J} (2J+1)\langle (\alpha_p\alpha_i)J | \tilde{v} | (\alpha_p\alpha_i)J \rangle,
label{eq:spequation2}
\end{equation}
!et
where the first equation contains a two-body force only while
Eq. (ref{eq:spequation2}) includes the medium-modified contribution
from the three-body interaction as well. 

!split
===== Linking the monopole part with Hartree-Fock theory, more definitions  =====

In
Eqs. (ref{eq:spequation1}) and (ref{eq:spequation2}), we have
used a compact notation for the single-particle states, with the
symbol $\alpha_p$ etc representing all possible quantum numbers except
the magnetic substates $m_{j_p}$, that is $\alpha_p=(n_p,l_p,j_p,t_{z_p})$. The symbol $\alpha_F$ stands now for
all single-particle states up to the Fermi level, excluding again the
magnetic substates.  In the above two-body interaction matrix elements
$\langle (\alpha_p\alpha_i)J | \hat{v}(\tilde{v}) |(\alpha_p\alpha_i)J \rangle$ we have dropped additional quantum
numbers like the isospin projection. Our interactions are diagonal in
the projection of the total isospin but breaks both isospin symmetry
and charge symmetry.


!split
===== Final expressions for the monopole term  =====

Using the definition of the single-particle energy in
Eq. (ref{eq:spequation1}), the definition of the monopole matrix
element in Eqs. (ref{eq:monopole1}) or (ref{eq:monopole2}) and Eq. (ref{eq:jvalue}), we can rewrite
Eq. (ref{eq:spequation1}) as

!bt
\begin{equation}
\epsilon_{\alpha_{p}}=\langle \alpha_p|\hat{h}_0|\alpha_p\rangle+\sum_{\alpha_i\le \alpha_F}N_{\alpha_i}\bar{V}_{\alpha_p\alpha_i},
label{eq:spmono1}
\end{equation}
!et
with $N_{\alpha_i}=2\alpha_i+1$, and Eq. (ref{eq:spequation2}) as

!bt
\begin{equation}
\epsilon_{\alpha_{p}}=\langle \alpha_p|\hat{h}_0|\alpha_p\rangle+\sum_{\alpha_i\le \alpha_F}N_{\alpha_i}\tilde{V}_{\alpha_p\alpha_i}.

===== Analyzing our results, decomposing the Hamiltonian  =====

The effective interaction is a
scalar two-body operator. A general scalar two-body operator
$\hat{v}$ can be written as

!bt
\begin{equation}
\hat{v} = \sum_{k} \hat{v}_{k} = \sum_{k} \mbox{\boldmath $C^{(k)}\cdot
Q^{(k)}$},
\end{equation}
!et
where the operators \mbox{\boldmath $C^{(k)}$} and
\mbox{\boldmath $Q^{(k)}$} are irreducible spherical tensor
operators of rank $k$, acting in spin and coordinate space,
respectively. The value of $k$ is limited to $k\le 2$ since the total eigenspin of the two-nucleon
system is either $0$ or $1$. The term with
$k=0$ refers to the central component of the two-body
operator.
The values of $k=1$ and $k=2$ are called
the vector and the tensor components, respectively. The vector term is also called the two-body spin-orbit term, although it
also contains the anti-symmetric spin-orbit term.
Using standard angular momentum algebra it is rather straightforward to relate the matrix elements  $\hat{v}_{k}$ to
those of say $\hat{v}$ or $\tilde{v}$. 

!split
===== Analyzing our results, decomposing the Hamiltonian  =====

One possible decomposition of the effective interaction is to
express the $k$-th component of the interaction $\langle
(\alpha_p\alpha_q)J|\hat{v}_{k}|(\alpha_r\alpha_s)J\rangle $ in a $jj$-coupled basis, where
$\hat{v}_k$ is related to the matrix
elements $\langle (\alpha_p\alpha_q)J|\hat{v}|(\alpha_r\alpha_s)J\rangle $ (or $\langle (\alpha_p\alpha_q)J|\tilde{v}|(\alpha_r\alpha_s)J\rangle $ 
through the relation


!bt
\begin{align}
\langle (\alpha_p\alpha_q)J|\hat{v}_{k}|(\alpha_r\alpha_s)J\rangle&=(-1)^{J}(2k+1)
\sum_{LL'SS'}\langle
\alpha_p\alpha_q|LSJ\rangle \langle \alpha_r\alpha_s|L'S'J\rangle
\left\{ \begin{array}{ccc}

		 \right\} \nonumber \\
& &\times \sum_{J'}(-1)^{J'}(2J'+1)\left\{ \begin{array}{ccc}
		       L&S&J'\\
		       S'&L'&k
		       \end{array}
		 \right\}
\sum_{\alpha_{p}'\alpha_{q}'\alpha_{r}'\alpha_{s}'}\langle \alpha_p'\alpha_q'|LSJ'\rangle
\nonumber\\
& &\times \langle \alpha_r'\alpha_s'|L'S'J'\rangle \langle
(\alpha_p'\alpha_q')J'|\hat{v}|(\alpha_r'\alpha_s')J'\rangle .  label{eq:jj}

===== Analyzing our results, decomposing the Hamiltonian  =====

The two-particle matrix elements are normalized and antisymmetrized.
A similar expression applies to the medium-modified two-body interaction $\tilde{v}$ of 
Eq. (ref{eq:twobodyveff}) as well.
The symbol $\langle \alpha_p\alpha_q|LSJ \rangle $ is a shorthand
for the $LS-jj$ transformation coefficient,

!bt
\begin{equation*}
\langle \alpha_p\alpha_q|\lambda SJ \rangle = \sqrt{(2j_{p}+1)(2j_{q}+1)(2\lambda+1)(2S+1)}
\left\{
\begin{array}{ccc}
       l_{p}&\frac{1}{2}&j_{p}\\
       l_{q}&\frac{1}{2}&j_{q}\\
       \lambda    &S          &J
\end{array}
\right\}
\end{equation*}
!et

!split
===== Analyzing our results, decomposing the Hamiltonian  =====
The transformation from an $LS$ basis to a $jj$-coupled scheme is then given by the relation

!bt
\begin{equation*}
|(\alpha_p\alpha_q)J\rangle  = \sum_{LS}\langle \alpha_p\alpha_q|LSJ \rangle |(\tilde{\alpha}_p\tilde{\alpha}_q)LSJ\rangle,
\end{equation*}
!et 
where the symbol like $\tilde{\alpha}_{p}$ refers to the quantum numbers in an $LS$ basis, that is
$\tilde{\alpha}_{p}=(n_{p},l_{p},s_{p},t_{z_{p}})$.

To derive Eq. (ref{eq:jj}), we have used the fact that the two-body
matrix elements of $\hat{v}_k$ can also be interpreted in the
representation of the $LS$-coupling scheme. 

!split
===== Analyzing our results, decomposing the Hamiltonian  =====
Similar to the
decomposition in the $jj$-scheme, the $LS$-coupled matrix element of a
given component $k$ $\langle(\tilde{\alpha}_p\tilde{\alpha}_q
  )LSJ'T\vert \hat{v}_{k}\vert (\tilde{\alpha}_r\tilde{\alpha}_s )LSJ'T\rangle $
are related to the corresponding matrix elements of the total
interaction in the $jj$-scheme by

!bt
\begin{equation*}
\begin{array}{ll}
&\\
\langle(\tilde{\alpha}_p\tilde{\alpha}_q )LSJ'T\vert\hat{v}_{k}\vert (\tilde{\alpha}_r\tilde{\alpha}_s )L'S'J'T\rangle&=
{\displaystyle\frac{1}{\sqrt{(1+\delta_{\tilde{\alpha}_p\tilde{\alpha}_q})(1+\delta_{\tilde{\alpha}_r\tilde{\alpha}_s})}}}
(-1)^{J'}\hat{k}\left\{\begin{array}{ccc}L&S&J'\\S'&L'&k

\langle \alpha_p\alpha_q|LSJ\rangle
\langle \alpha_r\alpha_s|L'S'J\rangle
\\&\\
&\times\sqrt{(1+\delta_{\alpha_p\alpha_q})(1+\delta_{\alpha_r\alpha_s})}\langle(\alpha_p\alpha_q)JT\vert\hat{v}\vert (\alpha_r\alpha_s)JT\rangle
